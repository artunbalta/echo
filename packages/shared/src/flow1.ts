/**
 * FLOW 1 — "Scarcity, Learning, Solving" (still alone), as EMBODIED animated activities
 * (ECHO_level_design_7flows.md §FLOW 1). This is the data-driven contract for the embodied rebuild:
 * an interaction is a *performed activity* (walk, gather, assemble, launch, plant, dig, study), and
 * the measurement is extracted from the **manner** of the performance — thoroughness, deliberation,
 * persistence-after-failure, decorative flourish — carried as CONTINUOUS `raw_signals` scalars, not
 * from a single button press. Two people building the same raft in different styles emit different
 * scalars → different φ → measurably different posteriors (the individuation the menu model threw away).
 *
 * This is the single source of truth the client scene (WorldClient / the F1 activity runner) and the
 * headless evidence walkthrough (services/ml/scripts/flow1_embodied_walkthrough.py) both follow, so the
 * playable beats and the proven posterior movement can never drift apart.
 *
 * Per cross-cutting rule #1 the cue→axis lines are PRIORS (learned in W). Cues whose doc-intended axis
 * is *openness* (decoration, explore-ratio, heading-variance) have no telemetry→openness path in the
 * committed W — they are carried honestly on the nearest own-axis feature or captured-unrouted, flagged
 * ⚑ in docs/known-gaps.md (#2, #6), NEVER silently re-routed.
